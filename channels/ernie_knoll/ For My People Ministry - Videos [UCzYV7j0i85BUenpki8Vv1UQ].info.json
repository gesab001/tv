White, who was a messenger of the Lord. This is the rule of our faith and practices, given to us by God through the inspiration of His Holy Spirit. We keep the Sabbath, according to the commandment in Exodus 20:8-11, which is Saturday, the seventh day of the week. We also look forward to Christ’s Second Coming. (Matthew 24:30; 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17; Revelation 1:7). \n", "tags": [], "thumbnails": [{"url": "https://yt3.googleusercontent.com/dRZOQmLfSsmk-z9sSv8VArkWRdQBubKrRKL83OGMkCOz2Of6i5kwhY7tRGA9e7FpbvBR9Wje8g=s900-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "height": 900, "width": 900, "id": "0", "resolution": "900x900"}, {"url": "https://yt3.googleusercontent.com/dRZOQmLfSsmk-z9sSv8VArkWRdQBubKrRKL83OGMkCOz2Of6i5kwhY7tRGA9e7FpbvBR9Wje8g=s0", "id": "avatar_uncropped", "preference": 1}], "uploader_id": "@ernieknoll", "uploader_url": "https://www.youtube.com/@ernieknoll", "playlist_count": 41, "uploader": " For My People Ministry", "channel_url": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzYV7j0i85BUenpki8Vv1UQ", "_type": "playlist", "extractor_key": "YoutubeTab", "extractor": "youtube:tab", "webpage_url": "https://www.youtube.com/@ernieknoll/videos", "webpage_url_basename": "videos", "webpage_url_domain": "youtube.com", "epoch": 1715466613, "_version": {"version": "2024.04.09", "release_git_head": "ff07792676f404ffff6ee61b5638c9dc1a33a37a", "repository": "yt-dlp/yt-dlp"}}
